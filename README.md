Cats vs Dogs Image Classification
- This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as cats or dogs using a dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset
- Source: Dogs vs. Cats Dataset on Kaggle

- Format: JPEG images inside folders labeled cat and dog

- Note: Place the extracted dataset inside a folder named data/train

Tools & Libraries
- Python

- TensorFlow / Keras

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

Project Steps
- Load and preprocess image data

- Data augmentation and splitting into train/validation sets

- Build a CNN model using Keras

- Train the model and plot accuracy curves

Files
- cats_vs_dogs_classifier.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the full code

- README.md: Project summary and instructions

Key Highlights
- Achieves good validation accuracy with a simple CNN

- Uses data augmentation for better generalization

- Easily extendable for other binary classification tasks
